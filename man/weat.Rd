\title{Speedy Word Embedding Association Test}
\usage{
weat(w, S_words, T_words, A_words, B_words, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{a numeric matrix of word embeddings, e.g. from \code{\link{read_word2vec}}}

\item{S_words}{a character vector of the first set of target words. In an example of studying gender stereotype, it can include occupations such as programmer, engineer, scientists...}

\item{T_words}{a character vector of the second set of target words. In an example of studying gender stereotype, it can include occupations such as nurse, teacher, librarian...}

\item{A_words}{a character vector of the first set of attribute words. In an example of studying gender stereotype, it can include words such as man, male, he, his.}

\item{B_words}{a character vector of the second set of attribute words. In an example of studying gender stereotype, it can include words such as woman, female, she, her.}

\item{verbose}{logical, whether to display information}
}
\value{
A list with class \code{"weat"} containing the following components:
\describe{
\item{\code{$S_diff}}{for each of words in S_words, mean of the mean differences in cosine similarity between words in A_words and words in B_words}
\item{\code{$T_diff}}{for each of words in T_words, mean of the mean differences in cosine similarity between words in A_words and words in B_words}
\item{\code{$S_words}}{the input S_words}
\item{\code{$T_words}}{the input T_words}
\item{\code{$A_words}}{the input A_words}
\item{\code{$B_words}}{the input B_words}
}
\code{\link{weat_es}} can be used to obtain the effect size of the test; \code{\link{weat_resampling}} for a test of significance.
}
\description{
This functions test the bias in a set of word embeddings using the method by Caliskan et al (2017). If possible, please use \code{\link[=query]{query()}} instead.
